pwd - present working directory (shows you which directory you're currently in. usually "/" at the beginning aka root :) )
ls - list (shows you all the VISIBLE files in the directory)
ls -a - (shows you ALL files in the directory)
cd home - change directory "home" ( it will go to the directory called "home" )
cd DoCuMenTs - change directory !!!: linux terminal is case sensitive
mkdir "name of your directory" - make directory
cd .. - takes you back to the previous directory
cd ~ - brings you back to "home" directory
cd / - brings you back to root directory
cd /home/kids/Documents - if you want to go "Documents" from "Root" you have to write down the exact passageway
rmdir "name of the directory" - remove directory (delete, no question!!!). It not works if there is file in the directory!
rm -R - remove directory and the files within the directory (!!! BE CAREFUL W IT)
nano - one of the programs that linux command line is bundled together with. Nano is a text editor.
  nano "helloworld" - runs the "helloworld" text (in case you have one :) ). In linux you have to specify the program
  which you are firing the file up.
