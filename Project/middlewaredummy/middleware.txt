## Backend resource updating middleware

As a frontend developer i want that every request updating the resources, so i can always get the right data back.

Checklist:
- Resource model updated with a current timestamp. ok
- Difference calculated from the current time and the resource last timestamp. ok
- New amount calculated from the difference multiplying by the generation. ok
- Resource updated with the new timestamp. 
- All the POST and PUT endpoint use this middleware. ok?

```gherkin
Scenario 1:
Given all the POST, PUT endpoints (except login, register).
When i send a request to it.
Then the resources updating.
```

- dummy endpoint
- if we send a request to the dummy endpoint it will UPDATE timestamp
- routers are about nesting servers inside servers
